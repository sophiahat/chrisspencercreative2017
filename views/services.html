                                <p>Whether it is salvaging poor audio or just putting on the finishing touches, I can get your audio sounding great, fast. The right tools and expertise will optimize your projectâ€™s audio quality and give it that professional sheen everyone expects.</p>

<p>Often the dialog in a project needs a little help... some breath, click and pop removals; some level balancing and some slight EQ touches.  Taken as a whole, these incremental steps can really add impact to any video, audiobook or mixed media project.  Many times it comes down to finding the right ambience to make the elements blend together and feel like they are in the same space.  Or perhaps there's too much competition for the same piece of the audio spectrum, and some things need to be equalized to allow them to work together.  Even if you're 90% there, its that extra 10% that will put your project over the top!</p>

                                <p>Dialogue tracking, editing and replacement. Superb microphones and gear make it easy to achieve a clean synchronized dialogue track.</p>

<p>Often times the audio captured at the shoot is sub par, and if its not dealt with it can lower the overall quality of your piece and become a real distraction. Whether its actual dialog replacement or unsynched voice over, I can help you assemble that 'larger than life' performance into a showcase piece.
